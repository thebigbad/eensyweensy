Eensy Weensy is an example webspider. Along with a forthcoming blog post, this should be enough to get you started writing your own Poor Man's webspider.

Prerequisites
-----

* [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html)
* [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748)
* PHP installed on a server you have access to (like localhost). When I was setting up my first LAMP server, I went to [Ubuntu's directions](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP) and copied and pasted my way to victory--maybe it'll help you. Advanced readers will be able to adapt the PHP bit to whatever language they like.
