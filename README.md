Eensy Weensy
====

Eensy Weensy is an example webspider. It's designed to scrape urls of blog posts from [http://borderstylo.com](http://borderstylo.com) and output them to a text file. The example is silly, but along with a forthcoming blog post, this should be enough to get you started writing your own Poor Man's webspider.

Naming
-----

The Eensy Weensy Spider is the protagonist of a children's song (see wiki's [Eensy Weensy Spider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eensy_Weensy_Spider) for more details). I feel its' smallness, fragility and resilience are qualities which are also found in this webcrawler (riiight).

Prerequisites
-----

* [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html)
* [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748)
* PHP installed on a server you have access to (like localhost). When I was setting up my first LAMP server, I went to [Ubuntu's directions](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP) and copied and pasted my way to victory--maybe it'll help you. Advanced readers will be able to adapt the PHP bit to whatever language they like.

Usage
-----

* Save this project wherever your PHP scripts like to be kept (/var/www for example)
* Edit spider.home in eensyweensy.user.js to point to eensyweensy.php
* Open eensyweensy.user.js in Firefox, then click "Install"
* Open [http://borderstylo.com/posts](http://borderstylo.com/posts)

 TODO: once eensyweensy.php is written, include sample output here
